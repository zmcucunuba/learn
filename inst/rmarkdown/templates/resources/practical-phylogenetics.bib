                 chimpanzees, we developed a new mathematical method for

                 substitutions per site, as well as the total number of

                 rate among different sites are all taken into account.
                 Application of this method to human and chimpanzee data
                 suggested that the transition/transversion ratio for the
                 entire control region was approximately 15 and nearly the same
                 for the two species. The 95\% confidence interval of the age

                 been made in selecting appropriate models for phylogeny

                 maximum likelihood (ML) and performing Hadamard conjugation.

                 and functionality, the popularity of the ape (analysis of
                 phylogenetics and evolution) software package has grown
                 steadily over the years. Among its features, it has a strong
                 distance-based component allowing the user to compute
                 distances from aligned DNA sequences based on most methods
                 from the literature and also build phylogenetic trees from
                 them. However, even data generated with modern genomic
                 approaches can fail to give rise to sufficiently reliable
                 distance estimates. One way to overcome this problem is to
                 exclude such estimates from data analysis giving rise to an
                 incomplete distance data set (as opposed to a complete one).
                 So far their analysis has been out of reach for ape. To remedy
                 this, we have incorporated into ape several methods from the
                 literature for phylogenetic inference from incomplete distance
                 matrices. In addition, we have also extended ape's repertoire
                 for phylogenetic inference from complete distances, added a
                 new object class to efficiently encode sets of splits of taxa,
