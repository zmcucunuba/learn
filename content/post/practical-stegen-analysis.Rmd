# Univariable and stratified analysis

This practical is a continuation of the analysis concerning the outbreak of gastroenteritis after a high school graduation dinner in Stegen, Germany. The [introduction to this case is presented in part 1](./stegen-introduction.html), which focussed on initial data inspection and cleaning. [Part 2](./practical-stegen-descriptive.html) focussed on descriptive statistics. This practical will focus on univariable and stratified analysis. To identify (the) potential vehicle(s) in the outbreak, proceed with an analytical study where you use statistical tests to investigate the associations of some suspicious food items with the disease.

> If you get stuck with any of the tasks in this practical, additional information for each task can be found in the [**Help** section](#help) 

## Preparing packages and data

```{r stegen-2, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("epiR")
library("Hmisc")
library("epitools")
library("here")
library("incidence")
```

```{r stegen-3, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Function to make tables with counts, proportions and cumulative sum
big_table <- function(data, useNA = "no") {
  count <- table(data, useNA = useNA)
  prop <- round(prop.table(count)*100, digits = 2)
  cumulative <- cumsum(prop)
  rbind(count,
        prop,
        cumulative) 
}

 # Function to provide counts, denominator and proportions (equivalent of attack rate)
attack_rate <- function(table) {
  prop <- round(prop.table(table, 1), digits = 2)
  denominator <- rowSums(table) 
  output <- cbind(Ill = table[, 2], N = denominator, Proportions = prop[, 2])
  return(output)
}
```

```{r stegen-4, eval = FALSE}
stegen_data <- read.csv(here::here("data", "stegen_clean.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r stegen-4.1, results = 'hide', echo = FALSE}
stegen_data <- read.csv(here::here("static", "data", "stegen_clean.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

## Question 1:  What is/are the vehicle/s for this outbreak?

### a) Compute food-specific attack rates and % of cases exposed

### b) Choose the appropriate measure of association and the appropriate statistical tests and appropriate level of confidence 

### c) Look at the proportion of cases exposed

What would be your suspected food item at this point?

### d) Compute the proportion of cases exposed for each exposure

### e) Search for any dose response if appropriate

Consider whether you would recode this variable so it has fewer categories, and actually do it.


### f) Interpret the results and identify the outbreak vehicle if any.

## Question 2:  Assess whether the chocolate mousses were the vehicles of the illness.
Consider effect modification and confounding.

## Question 3: Assess whether beer had a protective effect on the occurrence of illness

## Question 1

<details>
<summary> <b> a)-d) </b> </summary>

As we are carrying out a cohort study, the appropriate measure of association is relative risk. 

The appropriate statistical test for determining a p-value is a Chi-squared test of comparison of proportions. 

For our analyses we will use a 95% confidence level, as this is the standard used in public health.

The outputs required for a, c and d are provided by the same function as described below. There are a number of ways to calculate food-specific attack rates and the proportion of cases exposed to specific exposures in R. Below you will see two approaches. The first approach gives us the % of cases exposed to tiramisu. 


```{r stegen-19}
# The first element will be rows and the 2nd will be columns
count <- table(tiramisu = stegen_data$tira,  ill = stegen_data$ill)

# Here we select row % of count by including ,1 in the prop.table section
prop <- round(prop.table(count, 1), digits = 2) 

# We obtain the denominator using the rowSums function
denominator <- rowSums(count) 

# We combine all the elements together using cbind (binding by columns)
tira <- cbind(Ill = count[, 2], N = denominator, Proportions = prop[, 2])
tira
```

Alternatively, we can use a user-written command called single variable analysis.v.02 (developed by Daniel Gardiner Cohort 2015).

```{r stegen-20, eval = FALSE}
# This function needs to be saved in the same folder as the working directory
source(here::here("scripts", "single.variable.analysis.v0.2.R"))
```
```{r stegen-20.1, echo = FALSE}
# This function needs to be saved in the same folder as the working directory
source(here::here("static/scripts/single.variable.analysis.v0.2.R"))
```

```{r stegen-21}
# specify your exposures of interest i.e. tira-pork
vars <- c("tira", "wmousse", "dmousse", "mousse", "beer", "redjelly", "fruitsalad", "tomato", "mince", "salmon", "horseradish", "chickenwin", "roastbeef", "pork")
```

```{r stegen-22}
#NB. click on "sva" in your global environment to view Daniel's source code and read his explanations
a <- sva(stegen_data, outcome = "ill", exposures = vars, measure = "rr", verbose = TRUE)
a
```

To calculate attack rates for age and sex, you can use the attack_rate function. 

```{r stegen-23}
# the attack_rate function acts on tables and not data (as in the big_table function)
counts_sex <- table(stegen_data$sex, stegen_data$ill)
attack_rate(counts_sex)

# We will be using the same age group split as in section 2, <30 and >30
stegen_data$agegroup <- ifelse(stegen_data$age >= 30, 1, 0)

counts_age <- table(stegen_data$agegroup, stegen_data$ill)
attack_rate(counts_age)

```

</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> e) Search for any dose response if appropriate </b> </summary>

Use the variable tportion and tabulate it. Consider whether you would recode this variable so it has fewer categories, and actually do it. 


```{r stegen-24}
# Tabulate tportion variable against illness using attack_rate function
counts_tportion <- table(tportion = stegen_data$tportion, ill = stegen_data$ill)
attack_rate(counts_tportion)
```
```{r stegen-25}
# Recode 3 portions of tportion as 2 portions
# Make a new variable called tportion2 that has the same values as tportion
stegen_data$tportion2 <- stegen_data$tportion
stegen_data$tportion2[stegen_data$tportion2 == 3] <- 2
```
```{r stegen-26}
# Calculate counts, proportions and sum of recoded tportion2
counts_tportion2 <- table(tportion2 = stegen_data$tportion2, ill = stegen_data$ill)
attack_rate(counts_tportion2)
```

Here you should be able to see that those who ate 2 or more portions of tiramisu have a higher attack rate than those that ate only 1 portion of tiramisu. Those who ate 1 portion of tiramisu have a higher attack rate than those who ate no tiramisu.

<details>
<summary> <b> f) Interpret the results and identify the outbreak vehicle if any </b> </summary>

Refer to the results of the **sva** output and identify likely vehicles.

Several food items seemed to be associated with the occurrence of illness; tiramisu, dark and white chocolate mousse, fruit salad, and red jelly. They can potentially explain up to 94, 76, 49, 46, and 45 of the 103 cases respectively. Investigators decided to identify their respective role in the occurrence of illness.

From the crude analysis, epidemiologists noticed that the occurrence of gastroenteritis was lower among those attendants who had drunk beer. They also decided to assess if beer had a protective effect on the occurrence of gastroenteritis.

## Question 2 and 3

<details>
<summary> <b> Details </b> </summary>

Identify the variables which are potential effect modifiers and confounders.

The `epi.2by2()` function in the epiR package can be used to to identify effect modifiers/confounders. Outcome and exposure variables of interest need to be **factor/categorical variables** prior to performing stratified analysis with this function and also need to be **relevelled from (0, 1) to (1,0)** so that they can be correctly organised in a 2 by 2 table.


```{r stegen-27}
# Convert outcome/exposure variables to factor variables and reorder them
# The variables of interest are identified by their column number but variable names could equally be used
vars <- colnames(stegen_data[, c(2, 6, 8:10, 12:21)])

for (var in vars) {
  stegen_data[[var]] <- factor(stegen_data[[var]], levels = c(1, 0)) # levels of the variable are now (1, 0) instead of (0, 1)
}
```

Stratify key exposure variables by exposure to tiramisu. We will use exposure to **wmousse** stratified by tiramisu as an example of the steps required and then run a loop over all variables of interest. 

```{r stegen-28}
# Make a 3-way table with exposure of interest, the outcome and the stratifying variable in that order
a <- table(wmousse = stegen_data$wmousse, 
           ill = stegen_data$ill, 
           tiramisu = stegen_data$tira)

# Use the epi.2by2 function to calculate RRs (by stating method = "cohort.count")
mh1 <- epiR::epi.2by2(a, method = "cohort.count")

# View the output of mh1
mh1

# We can select specific elements of mh1 using the $ twice as below
# Crude RR
mh1$massoc$RR.crude.wald 

# Stratum-specific RR
mh1$massoc$RR.strata.wald

# Adjusted RR
mh1$massoc$RR.mh.wald

# We can combine all of those elements in to a single table using rbind
results <- rbind(mh1$massoc$RR.crude.wald, 
                 mh1$massoc$RR.strata.wald, 
                 mh1$massoc$RR.mh.wald)


# We can label the rows of this table as below
rownames(results) <- c("Crude", "Strata 1", "Strata 0", "Adjusted")

results

```

We can write a function incorporating all these steps and run all of the variables of interest in one go. 

```{r rr_function}
strata_risk <- function(var, case, strat) {
  a <- table(var, case, strat)

  mhtable <- epiR::epi.2by2(a, method = "cohort.count")
  
  results <- rbind(
    mhtable$massoc$RR.crude.wald,
    mhtable$massoc$RR.strata.wald,
    mhtable$massoc$RR.mh.wald
  )

  rownames(results) <- c("Crude", "Strata 1", "Strata 0", "Adjusted")

  results
}
```

```{r mhrr_table}
# List the exposure variables
vars <- c("wmousse", "dmousse", "mousse", "beer", "redjelly", "fruitsalad", "tomato", "mince", "salmon", "horseradish", "chickenwin", "roastbeef", "pork") 

# Run strata_risk for each one using tiramisu as strata
lapply(stegen_data[vars], strata_risk, case = stegen_data$ill, strat = stegen_data$tira)
```

Have a look at the association between beer and the illness. By stratifying the analysis on tiramisu consumption we can measure the potential protective effect of beer among those who ate tiramisu.   It seems that consumption of beer may reduce the effect of tiramisu consumption on the occurrence of gastroenteritis. The RR does not significantly differ between the two strata (0.8 vs. 1.0 and confidence intervals overlap). But, effect modification may be present. A similar stratification was conducted assessing dose response for tiramisu consumption among beer drinkers and no-beer drinkers.

After stratifying beer consumption by the amount of tiramisu consumed, it appeared that beer consumption reduced the effect of tiramisu on the occurrence of gastroenteritis only among those who had eaten an average amount of tiramisu. This is suggesting that, if the amount of tiramisu was large, consumption of beer no longer reduced the risk of illness when eating tiramisu.
