This lecture introduces general concepts pertaining to phylogenetic tree
reconstruction, as well as the main approaches used for building trees,
including distance-based, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods. It
also discusses phylogenetic uncertainty, bootstrap, and some caveats and bad
practices.
