# Stratified analysis 

This practical is a continuation of the analysis concerning the outbreak of 
gastroenteritis after a high school dinner in Copenhagen, Denmark. The 
[introduction to this case is presented in part 1](./copenhagen-intro.html),
which focussed on initial data inspection and cleaning.
[Part 2](./copenhagen-descriptive.html) focussed on descriptive statistics.
From [the univariate analysis conducted in part 3](./copenhagen-univariate.html), you can see that those eating pasta or veal as well as drinking champagne have the highest risk of becoming ill. There are, however, many other food items that are associated with an increased risk (even if not statistically significant). At this stage we cannot conclude anything, but need to check for effect modification and confounding. This should be done by stratification.


## Preparing packages and data

```{r load_packages, echo = TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("skimr")
library("Hmisc")
library("epiR")
library("incidence")
library("here")
```


```{r read_stratified, eval = FALSE}
# read in your data from a csv file 
# Select separator as comma (sep=",")
# do not import 'string' variables as 'Factors' (stringsAsFactors=FALSE) 
# Factors are a special datatype, covered later - character variables are simpler
# data frame read in and saved in R as "cph"

cph <- read.csv(here::here("data", "copenhagen_stratified.csv"),
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}

cph <- read.csv(here::here("static", "data", "copenhagen_stratified.csv"),
                stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

Make sure that your variables of interest are factors in the correct order. 
Outcome and exposure variables of interest need to be factor variables prior to using the function, in order to be relevelled from (0,1) to (1,0) so that they can be correctly organised in 2-by-2 tables. (We have already done this for our variables)

```{r reset_factors_again}
# We list the outcome/exposure variables
vars <- c("shrimps", "veal", "pasta", "sauce", "champagne", "rocket", "case")


# Convert all of those variables to factor variables and re-order the levels to aid interpretation
for (var in vars) {
  cph[[var]] <- factor(cph[[var]], levels = c(1, 0))
}
```

The `epi.2by2()` function in the *epiR* package can be used to identify effect modifiers/confounders. 

```{r three_way_table}
# Make a 3-way table with exposure of interest, the outcome and the stratifying variable, in that order
a <- table(cph$veal, cph$case, cph$pasta)

# Use the epi.2by2 function to calculate RRs (by stating method = "cohort.count")
mhtable <- epiR::epi.2by2(a, method = "cohort.count")

# view the output
mhtable

```


You can then extract various outputs from the `epiR::epi.2by2()` table for piecing together your own output. 
Take a couple of mintues to scan the documentation for `epiR::epi.2by2()` to see what outputs are named.

> *hint:* in your R console, type `?epiR::epi.2by2()` and look for the section called "Value"
Here two levels of `$`-signs are needed, as the function saves outputs to a list. 

```{r extract_data}
# Crude RR
mhtable$massoc$RR.crude.wald

# Stratum specific RRs
mhtable$massoc$RR.strata.wald

# Adjusted RR
mhtable$massoc$RR.mh.wald

# You can combine all of those elements in to a single table using rbind
results <- rbind(
  mhtable$massoc$RR.crude.wald,
  mhtable$massoc$RR.strata.wald,
  mhtable$massoc$RR.mh.wald
)


# We can label the rows of this table as below
rownames(results) <- c("Crude", "Strata 1", "Strata 0", "Adjusted")

# view output table
results

```



Like we did before, we can use these steps to write a function:

```{r risk-ratio-fun}
strata_risk <- function(var, case, strat) {
  a <- table(var, case, strat)

  mhtable <- epiR::epi.2by2(a, method = "cohort.count")
  
  results <- rbind(
    mhtable$massoc$RR.crude.wald,
    mhtable$massoc$RR.strata.wald,
    mhtable$massoc$RR.mh.wald
  )

  rownames(results) <- c("Crude", "Strata 1", "Strata 0", "Adjusted")

  results
}
```

Now we can run all of the variables at once

```{r strata_more_variables}
# List the exposure variables
vars <- c("veal", "rocket", "shrimps", "champagne", "sauce")
# run strata_risk for each one using pasta as strata
lapply(cph[vars], strata_risk, case = cph$case, strat = cph$pasta)
```

The exact same can be done for veal (switch veal and pasta)

```{r, veal-as-strata}
# List the exposure variables
vars <- c("pasta", "rocket", "shrimps", "champagne", "sauce")
# run strata_risk for each one using veal as strata
lapply(cph[vars], strata_risk, case = cph$case, strat = cph$veal)
```

It appears that pasta confounds the association between eating veal and being 
a case. For a variable to be a confounder it needs to be associated both with 
the outcome (being a case) and with the exposure. We know from univariable 
analysis that pasta is associated with being a case, we can now check if it is 
also associated with veal.

```{r fishers}
# using a fisher's exact test

fisher.test(table(cph$pasta, cph$veal))
```

# Integrate the analysis steps in one master script file

This is easily done, if you have saved each of your analyses in a separate script (e.g. one for cleaning, descriptive, univariable and stratified each), you can create a master script by using the `rmarkdown::render()` function. 

Open a new R file and save it as `runAll.R`. Inside of this script, put the following:

```
rmarkdown::render(here::here("reports", "01-intro.Rmd"))
rmarkdown::render(here::here("reports", "02-descriptive-stats.Rmd"))
rmarkdown::render(here::here("reports", "03-univariate-analysis.Rmd"))
rmarkdown::render(here::here("reports", "04-stratified-analysis.Rmd"))
```


## Conclusions of the stratified analysis

We found that pasta consumption confounds the association between eating veal and being ill. The crude (univariable) result for veal suggests that veal is a risk factor (crude RR = 1.52, CI: 1.00-2.31), but when we adjust for the consumption of pasta we see that actually this result is due to the fact that most people who ate veal also ate pasta.
Within the stratum of the people who ate pasta, veal has no effect (RR = 1.19, CI: 0.59-2.40). The same holds within the stratum of people who didn't eat pasta (RR = 1.05, CI = 0.38, 2.92). This is why the adjusted MH-RR also suggests that veal has no effect (RRadj = 1.14, CI: 0.64-2.03).
This result taken together with the dose response relationship we found earlier for pasta gives additional evidence that there was something going on with the pesto!

## Microbiological analyses 

### Local clinical microbiology laboratory

The finding of *Salmonella spp.* is surprising because one would expect a median incubation period of at least 24 hours in a Salmonella outbreak. A look at the epidemic curve tells us that the median incubation period in this outbreak was <18 hours. It would also be unusual to have such a low proportion of positive stool samples (3 of 20), if Salmonella was the only pathogen causing the outbreak.
Most microbiology laboratories use conventional methods (culture and microscopy) for routine detection of common bacterial enteric pathogens; molecular approaches are used by specialised laboratories to screen for key pathogens and their virulence genes.
Further microbiological investigation is required involving specialised assays that are only usually undertaken by a reference laboratory, namely, detection assays for diarrhoeagenic *Escherichia coli* and norovirus. All stool samples implicated in the outbreak should be examined for these pathogens also.

### Reference laboratory results 

The fact that this was an outbreak where several aetiological agents were identified, may point to a contamination from an environmental source. It also makes it less likely that kitchen staff excreting bacteria could have contaminated the food (and we already know that kitchen staff claimed not to have had symptoms, and that their stools tested negative).
ETEC is among the leading bacterial causes of diarrhoea in the developing world in particular among children, as well as the most common cause of travellers' diarrhoea. It is increasingly being recognised as an important cause of diarrhoea also in the developed world. ETEC is transmitted by food or water contaminated with human (or maybe animal) faeces.
ETEC is defined by the expression of one or more enterotoxins. Two such classes of toxins exist, heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) and heat-stable enterotoxin (ST). ETEC may produce either LT, ST or both. Both toxins directly cause diarrhoea, but other virulence factors also exist. LT is similar to the cholera toxin.
Infection with ETEC can cause profuse watery diarrhea and abdominal cramping. Illness develops somewhat quicker than for other bacterial enteric infections, because of the presence of the toxins. Symptoms appear 1-3 days after exposure and usually last 3-4 days. Some infections may take a week or longer to resolve. Symptoms rarely last more than 3 weeks. Most patients recover with supportive measures alone and do not require hospitalization or antibiotics.
Diagnostics is not easily performed; most laboratories do not test for ETEC.

Note that the field of diarrhoeagenic *E. coli* involves other types also. *E. coli* constitute a large group of bacteria that occur naturally in the intestines of humans and animals. Most are non-pathogenic. However, several (six are generally recognized) groups of diarrhoea causing *E. coli*, exist. These include ETEC, but also other groups, among which are:


+EPEC (enteropathogenic *E. coli*), cause diarrhoea through an infectious mechanism not involving toxins. It mostly affects children under the age of 2. Is transmitted from person-to-person, sometimes via foods.
+ STEC, (shiga toxin producing *E. coli*), STEC (also known as VTEC and EHEC) are similar to EPECs in many ways, but additionally express shiga toxins. Because of this, these strains may cause HUS, haemolytic uremic syndrome.

### Food sample results

ETEC can be very difficult to isolate from food samples. Not isolating ETEC therefore does not exclude that ETEC was present in the sample. It is just extremely difficult to find it among all the other E.coli (a bit like looking for a needle in a haystack). In fact the presence of very high counts of generic *E. coli* in the food, suggests that ETEC was also there.
One strategy to increase the success would be to use an enrichment step. That means letting the bacteria grow - before trying to isolate ETEC - for some hours under conditions, where growth of ETEC would be favoured above other types of *E. coli* (if such conditions can be established). Or, if for instance it was known that the ETEC strain isolated from cases was resistant to a specific set of antibiotics, this could be utilized in the isolation process, by growing the food extracts in a medium containing these antibiotics. An alternative strategy would be to use PCRs directly addressing the ETECs or to detect the toxins directly. However, as the pathogenic ETEC likely were present in small amounts, this would also be difficult.

### PFGE results 

The four *Salmonella anatum* strains were found to have the same PFGE profile and 100% identity on the dendogram. The *S. anatum* isolate found in the food was also typed by PFGE and found to have the same profile. The other strains show greater diversity within the dendogram confirming that they are distinguishable strains.
Concerning ETEC, sixteen of the 17 O92:H- isolates were indistinguishable by PFGE whereas the PFGE profile of the remaining O92:H- isolate differed from the others by a few bands.

## Conclusions of the investigation 

In summary, it is fair to say that there was both epidemiological and microbiological evidence that the pasta salad with pesto was the most likely vehicle of transmission in this outbreak. Further investigations focused on how the pasta salad with pesto could have become contaminated and on lessons learned from this outbreak that could then communicated both the scientific community, the caterer and the general public.
