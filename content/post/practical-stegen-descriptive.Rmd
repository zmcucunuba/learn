# Descriptive analysis in *R*

This practical is a continuation of the analysis concerning the outbreak of gastroenteritis after a high school graduation dinner in Stegen, Germany. The [introduction to this case is presented in part 1](./stegen-introduction.html), which focussed on initial data inspection and cleaning. This practical will focus on descriptive stats including 2x2 tables and epicurves.

> If you get stuck with any of the tasks in this practical, additional information for each task can be found in the [**Help** section](#help) 

## Preparing packages and data

```{r stegen-2, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library("epiR")
library("Hmisc")
library("epitools")
library("here")
library("incidence")
```

```{r stegen-3, results = 'hide', message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# Function to make tables with counts, proportions and cumulative sum
big_table <- function(data, useNA = "no") {
  count <- table(data, useNA = useNA)
  prop <- round(prop.table(count)*100, digits = 2)
  cumulative <- cumsum(prop)
  rbind(count,
        prop,
        cumulative) 
}

 # Function to provide counts, denominator and proportions (equivalent of attack rate)
attack_rate <- function(table) {
  prop <- round(prop.table(table, 1), digits = 2)
  denominator <- rowSums(table) 
  output <- cbind(Ill = table[, 2], N = denominator, Proportions = prop[, 2])
  return(output)
}
```

```{r stegen-4, eval = FALSE}
stegen_data <- read.csv(here::here("data", "stegen_clean.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

```{r stegen-4.1, results = 'hide', echo = FALSE}
stegen_data <- read.csv(here::here("static", "data", "stegen_clean.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

# Descriptive Analysis

What are the main characteristics of your study population?

### a) Describe your dataset
Look at: 

* the number of observations and variable types
* mean, median, and maximum values for each variable

### b) Create summary tables with counts and proportions
For each variable in the dataset.

### c) Make a box plot and histogram of age

### d) Produce a table of the number of cases by date of onset

### e) Create an epicurve for this outbreak

* Use the incidence package, providing information on daily incidence
* Make sure the dates of onset are stored as "Date" objects

# Help

<details>
<summary> <b> a) Describe your dataset </b> </summary>

You can view the structure of your data set using the following commands:

```{r stegen-6}
# str provides an overview of the number of observations and variable types
str(stegen_data)

# summary provides mean, median and max values of your variables
summary(stegen_data)

# describe (from Hmisc package) provides no. of observations, missing values, unique levels of each variable
Hmisc::describe(stegen_data) 
```


"Summary" and "describe" can be applied to:  

* the whole dataset
* specific variables of interest  

In the example below we look at sex, age and pork in the **stegen_data** dataset. You can examine a variable within a dataset using the '`$`' sign followed by the variable name. 


```{r stegen-7}
# table will give a very basic frequency table (counts), 
table(stegen_data$sex)

# summary gives the mean, median and max values of the specified variable
summary(stegen_data$age)

# describe gives the number of data points, missing values and number of categories
describe(stegen_data$pork)

```

</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> b) Create summary tables with counts and proportions </b> </summary>

We can create individual tables for each variable with the following steps:

```{r stegen-9}
# Assign the counts of stegen_data$sex to the object "sex"
sex <- table(stegen_data$sex)

# Assign the proportion of stegen_data$sex to the object "prop" and round the values to 2 decimal places
prop <- round(prop.table(sex)*100, digits = 2)

# Assign the cumulative sum of stegen_data$sex to the object "cumul"
cumul <- cumsum(prop)

# Append/row bind the results of the three objects together and assign to the object table1
table1 <- rbind(sex,prop,cumul)
```

```{r stegen-10}
table1
```

We could also use the big_table function (on page 2), which does all of the above steps in one line.

```{r stegen-11}
big_table(stegen_data$sex)

big_table(stegen_data$beer)
```

We could use lapply to apply `big_table()` to each of our variables.

```{r stegen-12}
# List the variables of interest and use c() to combine the elements into a vector
vars <- c("ill", "tira", "beer", "pork", "salmon")

lapply(stegen_data[, vars, drop = FALSE], FUN = big_table)
```

<details>
<summary> <b> c) Make box plot and histogram of age </b> </summary>

You can use the following to examine the age distribution among people who attended the party, as well as only those and who fell ill. 

```{r stegen-13}
# Boxplot of the age of all who attended the party
boxplot(stegen_data$age)
```


```{r stegen-14, eval = FALSE}
# Histogram of the ages of those who attended the party and who fell ill

# Here we use the hist function to plot the age of cases only (ill == 1)
# You will see that RStudio creates a jpeg file in your working directory with the above path and filename.
age_hist_all <- hist(stegen_data$age[stegen_data$ill == 1],
                     xlab = "Age",
                     ylab = "No. of cases",
                     main = "Histogram of the ages of cases")
```

```{r stegen-15, echo = FALSE}
age_hist_all <- hist(stegen_data$age[stegen_data$ill == 1],
                     xlab = "Age",
                     ylab = "No. of cases",
                     main = "Histogram of the ages of cases")

```

If we believe that there are two identifiable age groups, then we can create a new age group variable using **one** of the following approaches:

```{r stegen-16}
# by using ifelse (similar to Excel if statements)
stegen_data$agegroup <- ifelse(stegen_data$age >= 30, 1, 0)
```
```{r stegen-17, eval = FALSE}
# Two alternative approaches
# The below are particularly useful when you want to create more than 2 categories
# by using cut
stegen_data$agegroup <- cut(stegen_data$age, c(0, 30, 150), labels = FALSE) - 1
# by using findInterval
stegen_data$agegroup <- findInterval(stegen_data$age, c(30, 150))
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> d) Number of cases by date of onset </b> </summary>

You can produce summary tables by person and time (no place variable provided) using the big_table function.

```{r stegen-18}
# Table 1: Descriptive epidemiology: Study population by sex
big_table(stegen_data$sex)

# Table 2: Descriptive epidemiology: Study population by age group
# useNA ="always" here allows you to see the proportion of NAs for this variable
big_table(stegen_data$agegroup, useNA = "always")

summary(stegen_data$age)

# Table 3: Descriptive epidemiology: Attack rate
big_table(stegen_data$ill)

# Table 4: Descriptive epidemiology: Cases by date of onset of illness
big_table(stegen_data$dateonset)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> <b> e) Create an epicurve for this outbreak </b> </summary>

```{r stegen-19}
# Make sure the dates are "Date" objects
stegen_data$dateonset <- as.Date(stegen_data$dateonset)

# Create the epicurve
stegen_incidence <- incidence::incidence(stegen_data$dateonset, interval = 1)
plot(stegen_incidence)
```
