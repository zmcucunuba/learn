# Univariable analysis (Cohort and case control)

This practical is a continuation of the analysis concerning the outbreak of 
gastroenteritis after a high school dinner in Copenhagen, Denmark. The 
[introduction to this case is presented in part 1](./copenhagen-introduction.html),
which focussed on initial data inspection and cleaning.
[Part 2](./copenhagen-descriptive.html) focussed on descriptive statistics.
This practical will focus on univariable analysis.
To identify (the) potential vehicle(s) in the outbreak, proceed with an analytical study where you use statistical tests to investigate the associations of some suspicious food items with the disease.

## Preparing packages and data

```{r load_packages, echo = TRUE, results='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("skimr")
library("Hmisc")
library("epiR")
library("incidence")
library("here")
```


```{r read_univariable_data, eval = FALSE}
# read in your data from a csv file 
# Select separator as comma (sep=",")
# do not import 'string' variables as 'Factors' (stringsAsFactors=FALSE) 
# Factors are a special datatype, covered later - character variables are simpler
# data frame read in and saved in R as "cph"

cph <- read.csv(here::here("data", "copenhagen_univariable.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 
```
```{r echo = FALSE}

cph <- read.csv(here::here("static", "data", "copenhagen_univariable.csv"), stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 
```


```{r source_script, eval = FALSE}
# Functions required

# Adds a function to create a nice table for univariable analysis
source(here::here("scripts", "single.variable.analysis.v0.2.R")) 
```

```{r echo = FALSE}

source(here::here("static", "scripts", "single.variable.analysis.v0.2.R")) 
```

There is more than one way to create univariable tables.
One gives you a two by two and quite a lot of info, and the other is user-written code which will provide you with nicer output. 

Think about which variables you might want to include when checking for effect modification or confounding. 
One common strategy is to base this decision on the univariable results obtained and a p-value threshold of 0.25. 
Also, food items that are known risk factors for gastroenteritis could also be included regardless of their univariable p-value.


## Detailed output (method 1)

In order to use the `epiR::epi.2by2()` function, we first need to convert the outcome and exposure variables into factor variables to facilitate interpretation.

Outcome and exposure variables of interest need to be factor variables prior to using the function, in order to be relevelled from (0, 1) to (1, 0) so that they can be correctly organised in 2-by-2 tables.

```{r convert_factors}
# We list the outcome/exposure variables
vars <- c("shrimps", "veal", "pasta", "sauce", "champagne", "rocket", "case")

# Convert all of those variables to factor variables and re-order the levels to aid interpretation
for (var in vars) {
  cph[[var]] <- factor(cph[[var]], levels = c(1, 0))
}
```


The `epi.2by2()` function from the *epiR* package can be used to calculate both risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs).
You can find out more information on the function by writing `?epiR::epi.2by2()` in the console. 
The `epiR::epi.2by2()` function requires data to be in a table format. 
We can specify that we want to calculate RRs or ORs by adding **method = "cohort.count"** or **method = "case.control"**, respectively. 
You can do that first for looking at the risk for being a case by exposure to shrimp in a cohort study design.

```{r get_2by2}
# Create a table with exposure and outcome variables
counts <- table(cph$shrimps, cph$case)

# Apply epi.2by2 function to the table
shrimp <- epiR::epi.2by2(counts, method = "cohort.count")

# to view the output
shrimp
```

Now that we know how to create this table, we can create a function with two arguments that will return the 2x2 table:

```{r get_2by2_fun}
epi_2by2 <- function(var, case) {
  counts <- table(var, case)
  res <- epiR::epi.2by2(counts, method = "cohort.count")
  res
}
```

Now we can use this function to calculate the epi tables for each variable:

```{r lotta_2by2s}
# vector of variables you want to run
vars    <- c("pasta", "veal", "champagne", "sauce", "shrimps")
my2by2s <- lapply(cph[vars], epi_2by2, case = cph$case)
```

Because the output is large, we can view them one by one with the `$` operator:

```{r view_2by2}
my2by2s$veal
my2by2s$shrimps
```


## Simplified output (method 2)

A much more straight forward way is to simply apply a user-written function which requires much less input from you. 
The *sva* function (Daniel Gardner, PHE) basically integrates the steps from above to create a nice output table. 

```{r run_sva_fun}
# You already sourced the function at the begining of this case study 
# if you haven't then type: source(here::here("scripts", "single.variable.analysis.v0.2.R"))
# nb. click on "sva" in your global environment to view source code and read explanations

# cohort study
sva(cph, outcome = "case", exposures = vars, measure = "rr", verbose = TRUE)

# cohort count
sva(cph, outcome = "case", exposures = vars, measure = "or", verbose = TRUE)
```

# Different statistical tests in *R*

Note that for the below tests, no tables are printed alongside, however you could create these tables using the table and propstable (for percentages) functions. 

## Is gender associated with being a case? 

```{r tests}
# using a chi-squared test
  # chisq.test funciton requires you to input a table
chisq.test(table(cph$sex, cph$case))


# using a fisher's exact test
fisher.test(table(cph$sex, cph$case))
```

## Is class associated with being a case?

Here you can either compare proportions, using the chi-squared test, or use the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test to compare distributions. 
For the Wilcoxon-Mann-whitney test to work, all variables need to be numeric - however it is not possible to go directly from a factor to a numeric. The intermediate is to turn it in to a character and then to a numeric. 

```{r tests2}
# Using chi-squared
chisq.test(table(cph$class, cph$case))

# using the wilcoxon test 
  # this is a ranksum test and the function pulls the counts numbers by itself

# change case from a factor to numeric
cph$case <- as.numeric(as.character(cph$case))

# run the wilcoxon 
wilcox.test(cph$class, cph$case)

```

## Is there a difference between age in males and females? 

```{r test_sex}
# Using a wilcoxon test
wilcox.test(cph$age, cph$sex)

# Using a t-test to see difference in mean if normally distributed 
  # shapiro tests if significantly different from normal distribution
shapiro.test(cph$age)

t.test(cph$age ~ cph$sex)
```

## Is there a dose-response relationship between the food items and being sick? 

Look at the food items that seem most suspicious to you. 
Hint: it's pasta and veal

There are two possible ways to do this. The first is to use the wilcox.test again, and the second is to calculate ORs using the `epi.2by2()` function. Using the `epi.2by2()` function for dose responses is a bit more dense (traditionally this would be done using regression), so we have not shown it here; if you would like to see the code for this it is available in the appendix. 


Here, we present a function in a different form to test this. Instead of taking
in two vectors, we are taking the names of both columns to make sure we don't
include any missing data. 

```{r test_the_veal}
test_DR <- function(var, case = "case", dataset) {
  # var is the name of the variable of interest
  # case is the name of the case definition. Here we set the default to "case"
  # dataset is the data frame with the variable and case definition
  # selects only those cases where dose response is filled out (not empty) and saves as a dataset
  dataset <- dataset[is.na(dataset[var]) == FALSE, ]
  
  # saves in "form" as a text
  # e.g. "pastaD ~ case" which can then be inserted in the wilcox.test to get dose response
  form <- as.formula(paste0(var, "~", "case"))
  
  # put your formula above into wilcox using the reduced dataset
  res <- wilcox.test(form, data = dataset)
  
  res
}
test_DR("vealD", case = "case", dataset = cph)
test_DR("pastaD", case = "case", dataset = cph)
```

## Conclusions of univariate analyses 

The interesting results here are that the two food items that are most suspicious are pasta and veal. In particular, the dose response relationship that was found for pasta points towards pasta as the potential vehicle. Pasta as such is unlikely to be contaminated, but as you can see in the label, it was served with pesto!
Before you jump to conclusions, be aware that this result could be due to confounding! Maybe pasta was clean but eaten by all the people who ate the food item that actually was contaminated!
