Beyond the availability of data and methods, reproducible science requires the
traceability of analyses. Whether it is for yourself or for collaborators, as
series of tools and good practices can facilitate your work flow, simplify
analyses, and prevent the loss of data and results. This lecture provides an
introduction to reproducibility using **R**.

# Related packages

## `knitr`

`knitr` provides excellent resources for literate programming mixing **R** with
[*LaTeX*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) or
[*markdown*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

It is extensively documented at: [https://yihui.name/knitr/](https://yihui.name/knitr/)

To install the current stable, CRAN version of the package, type:
```{r knitr-install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("knitr")
```

To benefit from the latest features and bug fixes, install the development
version of the package using:

```{r knitr-dev-install, eval = FALSE}
update.packages(ask = FALSE, repos = 'https://cran.rstudio.org')
install.packages('knitr', repos = c('https://xran.yihui.name', 'https://cran.rstudio.org'))
```


## `rmarkdown`

`rmarkdown` extends the capabilities of `knitr` with a more diverse set of
outputs generated from `Rmd` files, including pdf documents, article templates,
pdf or html slides, or even web applications.

More information on `rmarkdown` is available from: [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

To install this package, type:

```{r rmarkdown-install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```


For the devel version, type (uses `devtools`):
```{r rmarkdown-dev-install, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/rmarkdown")
```



## `lintr`

`lintr` will analyse your code and point out deviations from current good coding
practices. It can be ran on a `.R` file, but also can be used to analyse code
typed in real-time for a number of coding platforms including Rstudio, emacs and
others.

For more information on this package, go to:
[https://github.com/jimhester/lintr](https://github.com/jimhester/lintr).

To install this package, type:

```{r lintr-install, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("lintr")
```
